Assignment 3

1. The bug in the source code is that it doesn't handle empty lines (\n). This occurs in the parser for the program. min_failing_tests.txt includes a garbage value and a newline. These are what delta determined are the issues. 

2. All inputs that contain newlines appear to be the issue. The 
min_failing_test.txt file contained a garbage value and an empty line. The empty line
is what is causing the issue. While delta identifies the line with garbage values as 
an issue, it can be sorted by mysort.

3. There is a very simple fix for the bug. Within the main function, the parsing needs to handle the case where a line is empty. In the while(1) loop below the first if statement, add the following lines:

	if (s[0] == '\n')
		continue;
This allows the program to handle newlines. Recompile mysort and test with
min_failing_test.txt and big_failing_test.txt. The error should be resolved.
